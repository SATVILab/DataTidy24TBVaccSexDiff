# okay, so I need to describe the raw data, as well as the
# resultant tables.

# how to describe the raw data?
# maybe a vignette, giving info for each raw data file?
# well, I've got the data in a format that PLOS will find acceptable, I think.
# I think they would prefer it stored in a repository, but oh well.

# descriptions of
## R datasets
### done in R
### single page for all?
### see how it goes
### maybe make join17IncTbl and join17ExcTbl available

# could make a diagram of how the datasets link
# yes!
# well, this might just make extra work, as I'l
# have to have the data note in R, as well as a new vignette
# maybe I can do a vignette.
# describe the raw data in it, and then give the diagram of the transformed data.
# maybe this diagram can also just substitute for the coding flow
# have all the files coming in
# being transformed
# being joined
# removing IL17
# ya, I should do that.
# then individual pages can specify assumptions or whatever
#
# I'm not quite sure how to decribe this Wunderbar.
